# Codeforces Solutions in Python3

Welcome to my Codeforces solutions repository! This repository was created to share solutions to various problems on Codeforces, all written in Python3.

## Why This Repository?

Resources for competitive programming in Python3 aren't as widely available as they are for other languages. I hope this repository can be a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their skills in competitive programming using Python3.

## My Journey

This repository also serves as a documentation of my competitive programming journey. By sharing my solutions and learning from others, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills and become better at competitive programming.

## How to Use This Repository

Each solution is organized by the problem's Codeforces contest and problem number. You'll find a directory for each contest, and within each directory, the solutions to individual problems.

## Note

I am solving the problems based on their difficulty level, determined by the number of accepted submissions on the Codeforces problemset tab. This approach helps me gradually tackle more challenging problems as I improve my skills.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions! If you have a different or more efficient solution, feel free to create a pull request. Let's learn and grow together.

## Contact

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out to me. I hope you find this repository useful!

Happy coding!
